# 1. Most Influential Graduates

The W. Frank Barton School of Business at Wichita State University has cultivated a legacy of influential graduates who have shaped industries and communities both within Kansas and beyond. This section highlights notable alumni, beginning with those recognized through the School of Business Hall of Fame and exploring the accomplishments of successful entrepreneurs who have founded and led innovative ventures. Further examination will trace the contributions of early influential graduates and prominent industry leaders, demonstrating the breadth and depth of the school’s impact over the last century. These profiles showcase not only professional success but also a consistent commitment to civic engagement and support for Wichita State University.

## 1.1. Hall of Fame Inductees

The W. Frank Barton School of Business Hall of Fame recognizes graduates whose visionary leadership and outstanding contributions have shaped the institution. The inaugural class, inducted on February 17, 2024, includes W. Frank Barton, Clark Bastian, and Fran Jabara. W. Frank Barton, former president of Barton Distributors and co-founder of Rent-A-Center, contributed significantly to the local economy through these ventures and further bolstered the school with a $12 million endowment [39]. Clark Bastian, Chairman of the Board at Fidelity Bank, has overseen a financial institution with substantial assets and community investment within Kansas [39]. Fran Jabara, founder of the Center for Entrepreneurship at WSU, fostered an environment that has supported the creation of numerous businesses and innovative ventures, though a precise quantification of this impact remains to be determined [39].

More recently, Paul Allen, Dan Carney, and Steve Feilmeier were named 2026 “Beyond” Hall of Fame inductees. Paul Allen, Chief Executive of Allen, Gibbs & Houlik, L.C., leads a firm serving numerous clients and demonstrably contributing to the regional economy [5]. Dan Carney, co-founder of Pizza Hut, built a globally recognized franchise that originated in Wichita, Kansas, and continues to generate significant economic activity [5]. Steve Feilmeier, having served as Executive Vice President and CFO of Koch Industries, influenced the financial strategy of a corporation generating billions in revenue [5]. The “Beyond” Hall of Fame gala raises funds to support student success initiatives, contributing to the development of future economic drivers [39].

While a precise, comprehensive quantification of the economic impact of each inductee requires further research, their achievements demonstrate significant contributions to Kansas’s economic landscape. The Hall of Fame selection prioritizes professional achievement and engagement with Wichita State University, recognizing individuals who have demonstrably impacted both the business world and the community.

Having examined the Hall of Fame inductees and their contributions, the following section will delve into the accomplishments of Barton School graduates who have founded and led successful entrepreneurial ventures.

## 1.2. Entrepreneurs & Business Founders

Chris Wright [6], Liberty Energy (founded 2011), Market Capitalization: $3.33 billion, 5,500 employees [6]. Founder, CEO, and Chairman driving significant energy sector output.

Basil Hourani [30], Pulse Systems Inc. & Capital7 (founded 2000s) [30]. Co-founder managing investments in healthcare technology, software, and real estate [30].

Having examined the entrepreneurial achievements of Barton School graduates, the following section will explore the contributions of early influential alumni from the school’s formative years.

## 1.3. Early Influential Graduates (1926-1970)

Identifying influential graduates from the Barton School of Business’s early years (1926-1970) presents a challenge due to limited readily available documentation compared to more recent alumni [34]. Available sources do not provide detailed career trajectories of graduates from this period. However, the founding of the College of Business Administration and Industry in 1926, with its cooperative education model, suggests a focus on preparing students for immediate contributions to the Kansas workforce [8c5d4ab4, note_b0957b0b]. The mention of John W. Grooms, V.P. of Boulevard State Bank, on a plaque commemorating early contributors to the school suggests his significance within the banking sector and the Wichita business community during this timeframe [34]. Boulevard State Bank, at the time of Grooms’ involvement, held approximately $15 million in assets [34], indicating his role within a substantial regional financial institution. Similarly, the memorialization of students who perished in 1970 – Randall B. Kiesau, Thomas B. Owen, Jr., Thomas T. Shedden, and John R. Taylor – indicates their involvement within the business school and the broader Wichita community [34]. 

The establishment of Clinton Hall in 1970, named in honor of R.P. and Eleanor Clinton, highlights the importance of the oil industry to the region [34]. R.P. Clinton’s contributions to the oil industry, and his subsequent philanthropy, suggest a link between Barton School graduates and the burgeoning energy sector in Kansas during that era [34]. While specific data on the economic output of early Barton School graduates remains limited, the growth of industries like banking and oil in Kansas during this period suggests their contributions were significant. Further research is needed to identify specific individuals and quantify their impact with greater precision.

Having explored the limited information available on early influential graduates, the following section will focus on prominent industry leaders who have emerged from the Barton School of Business in more recent decades.

## 1.4. Industry Leaders

Wayne Woolsey [45], a 1978 graduate, founded Woolsey Companies, contributing to the oil and gas industry. His $10 million donation to Wichita State University supports workforce development [45].

Tanvir Arfi [33], founder, chairman, and CEO of Banyan Technology Group, leads a capital group focused on the automotive aftermarket industry [33].

Julie Towner [50], CEO of Towner Communications, a multi-million dollar firm, was selected for the 2025 Leadership Kansas class and recognized as a 2021 Kansas City Business Journal’s Women of Influence honoree [50].

Thomas R. Devlin, Sr. [11], President & Chairman of Devlin Enterprises, serves on the Wichita State University Foundation’s National Advisory Council [11].

Kimberly N. Ernzen [11], VP of Professional Relations at Delta Dental of Kansas, is a member of the Wichita State University Foundation’s National Advisory Council [11].

These leaders, and others recognized through the Alumni Achievement Award [36] and participation in the Leadership Kansas program [9], demonstrate the Barton School’s impact across diverse sectors.

Having highlighted key industry leaders, the following section will detail the impact of Barton School graduates on employment within Kansas.

# 2. Successful Graduates

The Barton School of Business at Wichita State University has produced a distinguished cohort of graduates who have excelled in a variety of fields. The following sections highlight notable alumni achievements, categorized by their professional focus. Specifically, we will examine successes in business and entrepreneurship, public service and leadership roles, contributions in the arts and athletics, and a dedicated overview of alumni currently holding significant leadership positions. This compilation demonstrates the wide-ranging impact of Barton School graduates on both the regional and national stage.

## 2.1. Business & Entrepreneurship

The W. Frank Barton School of Business has a strong track record of producing graduates who achieve success in the business world, both as executive leaders and as founders of their own companies. J. Robert Young, founder of Alpine Bank, exemplifies this entrepreneurial spirit [49]. Founded in 1973, Alpine Bank has grown to a $6.4 billion organization with approximately 890 employees and 170,000 customers [41]. Young’s dedication to philanthropy and community involvement is also notable, with Alpine Bank consistently supporting nonprofit organizations [49].  Dan and Frank Carney, co-founders of Pizza Hut, are also prominent Barton School alumni who achieved significant entrepreneurial success [5]. Gary Burrell, founder of Garmin, further demonstrates the school’s ability to cultivate innovative business leaders [14].  More recently, Erin Cummings, a 2009 graduate, launched the online jewelry brand Armine + Ambrose, showcasing a continued entrepreneurial spirit among Barton School graduates [56].

The school’s commitment to entrepreneurship is further evidenced by the establishment of the Center for Entrepreneurship in 1977 [42] and the emphasis on applied learning and innovation within its curriculum [21].  WSU’s Innovation Campus actively promotes partnerships between the university and private companies, fostering an environment conducive to entrepreneurial ventures [14].  The Barton School also offers a dedicated entrepreneurship major, the only one of its kind in the state of Kansas [29].  Alumni like Chris Wright, founder and CEO of Liberty Energy, demonstrate the impact of this education, leading a company with a market capitalization of $3.33 billion [6].  Basil Hourani, co-founder of Pulse Systems Inc. and Capital7, also exemplifies successful entrepreneurship [30].  Furthermore, the WSU Foundation and Alumni Engagement recently recognized 17 alumni as part of the 2025 40 Under 40 list, highlighting the achievements of young business professionals in the Wichita area [55].

The Barton School's focus on cultivating entrepreneurial talent extends to providing resources and mentorship opportunities for students. The Center for Entrepreneurship utilizes Entrepreneurs-in-Residence – such as Wright and Hourani – to share their expertise and guide aspiring business owners [26].  The school also offers scholarships specifically for entrepreneurship students, including the Fran Jabara entrepreneurship scholarships [29]. Having examined the success of Barton School alumni in business and entrepreneurship, the following section will explore their contributions to public service and leadership roles.

## 2.2. Public Service & Leadership

The Barton School of Business also produces graduates who dedicate their careers to public service and community leadership. Lily Wu, the current Mayor of Wichita, Kansas, is a prominent example, holding dual bachelor’s degrees from Wichita State University in international business and integrated marketing communication [12, 37]. Her election as the first woman and first Asian American mayor of Wichita demonstrates the school’s success in preparing alumni for significant roles in government [12, 37]. Mayor Wu’s continued involvement with the WSU Barton School of Business Dean’s Alumni Council and WSU Tech Advisory Board further highlights her commitment to the university and the Wichita community [12, 37]. Don Jordan, a 1974 graduate, served as Secretary of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services under Kansas Governors Kathleen Sebelius and Mark Parkinson, overseeing a $1.6 billion budget and 6,000 employees [35]. Sheldon Kamen, a 1973 alumnus, served as mayor of Wichita and on the Wichita City Council, demonstrating leadership at the local level [35]. Gary Miskimon, a 1974 graduate, currently serves as Director for the Administration and Parking Division for the City of San Jose and received the “Pride of San Jose” award for “Excellence” [35]. 

Several other alumni contribute to public service in various capacities. Paul Babich, a 1970 graduate, served on the Kansas Supreme Court Nominating Commission and the Historic Commission of the Wichita Catholic Diocese [35].  Dalton Glasscock, a 2017 graduate with degrees in Business and Political Science, currently serves as a Wichita City Councilman [53]. Taben Azad, a 2016 graduate with degrees in Political Science and Mechanical Engineering, served as President of the Wichita Asian Association, advocating for the AAPI community [53]. Eric F. Melgren, a 1979 graduate, serves as Chief United States District Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas [1, 15]. V. Kaye Monk-Morgan, a 1993 graduate, was named president and CEO of the Kansas Leadership Center [1]. Joseph W. Shepard, a 2016 and 2018 graduate, serves as chief of staff and director of Lead for America’s National Hometown Fellowship program in Wichita [1]. Elizabeth Bender Roe Cloud, while predating the modern Barton School structure, dedicated her life to education and activism for Native American self-determination as a Wichita-affiliated educator [6ba80531, note_b4306284]. 

These examples demonstrate a consistent pattern of Barton School graduates entering and excelling in public service roles at the local, state, and federal levels.  These contributions extend beyond elected office to include leadership within government agencies, non-profit organizations, and community initiatives. Having examined the contributions of Barton School alumni to public service and leadership, the following section will explore their accomplishments in the arts and athletics.

## 2.3. Arts & Athletics

The Barton School of Business at Wichita State University also boasts a number of successful alumni who have achieved prominence in the arts, sports, and entertainment industries [19]. While not always directly tied to business administration, these individuals demonstrate the diverse skillset and adaptability fostered by a Barton School education. Several alumni have excelled in the performing arts, particularly in opera. Alan Held [18, 24, 51] and Samuel Ramey [24, 31, 44, 51] are Grammy-winning opera singers and Wichita State University faculty members, bringing over 80 years of professional experience to the university [b928c4b4, note_52f14470]. Joyce DiDonato, another Grammy-winning opera singer, also counts herself among WSU’s successful arts alumni [ece4b7bb, note_0f19e329]. Karla Burns, an operatic mezzo-soprano and actress, received an honorary doctorate from Wichita State and an Olivier Award [31]. Beyond opera, alumni are active in theatre and performance. Dan E. Campbell [23] is a Los Angeles-based actor with credits in film, television, and theatre, even appearing in the Golden Raspberry Awards show [23]. Sai Baig Powers [23] works as a Stage Manager and Box Office Associate at Phoenix Theatre in Arizona [23].  

The Barton School also sees alumni success in sports-related fields. Luke Schuellin [13] currently manages business development for Viwa, a ticket management solution company within the sports and entertainment industry [13]. Fred VanVleet [1] achieved NBA All-Star status, joining Xavier McDaniel as WSU alumni to reach this milestone [1]. Natalie Samb [40], a 2013 graduate, leverages her WSU education and athletic background (as a member of the WSU Women's Golf Team) in her role as Membership Director at Topgolf [40]. Several other alumni have found success in sports-related roles, including Cody Proctor [23] as a performer and Zack Powell [23] with experience at multiple playhouses.  Additionally, alumni are involved in arts administration and preservation, such as Patty Reeder [23] as a co-founder and performer at Mosley Street Melodrama and Barbara Hammond [35] working in historic preservation for the City of Wichita [35]. These examples illustrate the breadth of achievement among Barton School alumni in the arts and athletic sectors.

Having highlighted the accomplishments of Barton School graduates in the arts and athletics, the next section will examine alumni who have attained leadership positions within various organizations.

## 2.4. WSU Business School Alumni in Leadership Positions

Several Barton School of Business graduates have ascended to prominent leadership roles across a diverse range of industries [54]. Richard Dinkel, holding both bachelor’s degrees from Wichita State University and Kansas University, exemplifies this success as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Koch Industries, Inc. [28, 38, 43, 57].  His responsibilities encompass Koch’s finance functions, including accounting, tax, treasury, risk, and IT, alongside leadership of Koch’s Global Services group [43, 57]. Dinkel also serves on the boards of directors for multiple Koch subsidiaries and the JDRF of Missouri and Kansas [43, 57].  Darren Ercolani, a 1984 Barton School graduate, serves as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP [4]. Ercolani’s career trajectory includes roles in business transformation, finance management, and international operations, demonstrating a broad skillset developed through his professional experience and WSU education [4]. Tom Gentile, CEO of Spirit AeroSystems, served as the first Executive-in-Residence at the Barton School of Business, underscoring the school’s commitment to connecting students with industry leaders [54].  

Furthermore, Tanvir Arfi, founder, chairman, and CEO of Banyan Technology Group, and Executive in Residence at Wichita State, demonstrates influential leadership within the automotive aftermarket industry [8]. Steve Feilmeier, a retired executive from Koch Industries, held the position of Executive Vice President and CFO, influencing the company’s financial strategy for nearly two decades [47]. Paul Allen, currently the chief executive of Allen, Gibbs & Houlik, L.C., also represents Barton School alumni in key leadership positions [47]. These individuals, alongside others like Richard Dinkel, highlight the Barton School’s success in cultivating leaders capable of navigating complex organizational structures and driving impactful results. The program's alumni are increasingly found in leadership positions, as evidenced by the inclusion of Koch CFO Richard Dinkel as the incoming Chair of the Barton School Dean’s Advisory Board [16, 27]. Having examined the achievements of Barton School alumni in leadership roles, the following section will detail the significant impact these graduates have on employment within Kansas.

# 3. Impact on Employment in Kansas

The Barton School of Business at Wichita State University plays a significant role in shaping the Kansas workforce and contributing to the state’s economic vitality. This section examines the impact of Barton School graduates on employment within Kansas, beginning with an overview of graduate placement rates in key industries such as aerospace, agriculture, and technology. We will then explore broader alumni contributions to Kansas economic growth, highlighting entrepreneurial successes and leadership positions held by Barton School graduates, before detailing the top employers who actively recruit talent from the school. Finally, this section will quantify the overall economic impact generated by Barton School alumni within the state.

## 3.1. Graduate Placement Rates in Key Kansas Industries

Data indicates that Wichita State University (WSU) graduates, including those from the Barton School of Business, demonstrate a strong employment rate within Kansas [22]. Specifically, 73.6% of WSU graduates are employed in Kansas within one year of graduation, surpassing other state universities such as Emporia State, Fort Hays State, Pittsburg State, Kansas State, and the University of Kansas [22]. While this figure represents overall WSU graduates, the Barton School’s emphasis on applied learning and industry connections suggests a similarly high placement rate for its business graduates. The aviation industry remains a significant employer for WSU alumni, with graduates finding positions at Airbus, Bombardier-Learjet, Textron/Cessna/Beechcraft, and Spirit AeroSystems [20].  Furthermore, Koch Industries and Boeing actively participate in WSU’s co-op and internship programs, providing pathways to employment for Barton School students [20].

Recent graduate profiles further illustrate these trends. Prajakta Hatkar, a Master’s in Supply Chain Management graduate, completed Lean-focused projects with Lowe’s and Koch Industries during her studies, demonstrating a direct link between academic work and potential employment opportunities [187617a9, note_3a817f4b]. This showcases a pathway into key Kansas industries, particularly agriculture and commodities given Koch Industries’ involvement [187617a9, note_ca6121c5]. The agriculture sector also presents significant employment opportunities, with Barton Community College agriculture program graduates finding positions in crop and livestock production, farm management, and agricultural consulting [1b9b65dc, note_1019a615]. Individuals with a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture can expect to earn between $36,000 and $81,000 annually in Kansas [7].

Employment opportunities also exist within the technology sector, as demonstrated by Gary Burrell, a WSU alumnus and co-founder of Garmin [20]. The aerospace industry, particularly in the Wichita area, offers a high concentration of employment, with 1,690 aerospace engineers employed and an annual mean wage of $90,850 [3]. Kansas has a location quotient of 3.47 for aerospace engineering, indicating a higher concentration of employment than the national average [3]. Barton Community College reports numerous calls from employers seeking employees in agriculture and related industries, suggesting a strong demand for skilled workers in this sector [ed96050c, note_e8cdec2a]. These figures suggest that WSU Barton School graduates are well-positioned to secure employment in key Kansas industries.

Having examined the placement rates of Barton School graduates in key Kansas industries, the following section will explore the broader contributions of alumni to Kansas economic growth.

## 3.2. Alumni Contributions to Kansas Economic Growth

Quantifying the economic impact of Barton School of Business alumni on Kansas presents a complex challenge, but available data points to significant contributions across multiple sectors [42]. The W. Frank Barton School of Business has consistently produced graduates who establish successful businesses, hold leadership positions in major corporations, and contribute to the state’s economic vitality [34]. While a comprehensive, statewide study specifically tracking the economic output of Barton School alumni is lacking, several indicators demonstrate their influence. For example, Koch Industries, a major Kansas employer, actively recruits Barton School graduates and provides internship opportunities, such as those completed by Prajakta Hatkar during her Master’s program in Supply Chain Management [187617a9, note_deb3bffb]. This connection translates to direct employment and the application of Barton School-trained talent within a significant Kansas-based company.

Furthermore, alumni have founded and led successful businesses that contribute substantially to the state’s economy. Dan and Frank Carney, co-founders of Pizza Hut while students at Wichita State University, represent a prominent example of entrepreneurial success originating from the Barton School [42]. Though Pizza Hut is now a global entity, its origins in Wichita and its founders’ connection to the university underscore the school’s role in fostering innovation. Wayne Woolsey, a Barton School graduate and founder of Woolsey Companies, has also made significant contributions to the oil and gas industry, with a $10 million endowment to Wichita State University further demonstrating his commitment to economic development in the region [45]. More recently, Logan Brown, a Barton School graduate, founded Spencer Jane, a clothing company that has partnered with Wichita State to support the Women’s Innovation Fund [2].

The presence of Barton School alumni in key leadership positions also drives economic impact. Richard Dinkel, CFO of Koch Industries, and Darren Ercolani, CFO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, exemplify this trend [4, 43]. Their strategic decision-making within these major corporations influences investment, employment, and overall economic growth. A 2022 Economic Impact Study by Wichita State University’s Center for Economic Development and Business Research found that WSU and WSU Tech’s total economic impact in Kansas in 2021 was $1.3 billion, with a multiplier effect of 2.27, meaning for every $1 million spent, an additional $1.27 million of economic activity is supported within Kansas businesses [fd8a7b9d, note_a5bd5f49]. While this figure encompasses the entire university, the Barton School’s contribution to a skilled workforce directly supports this economic impact. The Barton School's Center for Economic Development and Business Research also demonstrated that Kansas state parks contributed over $170 million to the state's economy in 2020 [7dd18af1, note_28636bee].

The Barton School’s emphasis on entrepreneurship, coupled with its strong ties to local industries, positions its graduates to continue driving economic growth in Kansas. The establishment of the Center for Entrepreneurship in 1977 and the availability of the state’s only undergraduate entrepreneurship major underscore this commitment [29, 42]. The ongoing contributions of alumni, ranging from business founders to corporate leaders, demonstrate the Barton School’s lasting impact on the Kansas economy.  Having explored the contributions of Barton School alumni to Kansas economic growth, the following section will examine the top employers who actively recruit talent from the school.

## 3.3. Placement Rates and Top Employers

Data from the Office of Career and Professional Development at Wichita State University indicates that employers actively recruit Barton School of Business students and graduates [58]. Several major companies consistently participate in career fairs and on-campus recruitment events, seeking to fill positions with qualified Barton School talent [58]. While a definitive ranking of “top employers” based solely on recruitment volume isn’t readily available, consistent participants include Koch Industries, Spirit AeroSystems, Deloitte, and Enterprise Holdings [58]. Koch Industries, a significant Kansas employer, offers a wide range of opportunities for Barton School graduates, particularly in finance, accounting, and supply chain management [25]. Spirit AeroSystems, a leading aerospace manufacturer in Wichita, recruits Barton School students for roles in engineering, finance, and business administration [25]. Deloitte, a global professional services firm, actively seeks Barton School graduates for consulting and advisory positions [25]. Enterprise Holdings, a major player in the transportation industry, recruits for management training programs and other roles [25].

Beyond these consistently present employers, the Barton School also attracts recruitment from a diverse range of companies across various sectors [25]. These include financial institutions such as Fidelity Bank and INTRUST Bank, as well as technology companies and regional businesses [25]. The school’s location in Wichita, a major business hub in Kansas, provides students with access to a wide network of potential employers [52]. The Professional Edge program, designed to enhance students’ professional skills, also contributes to increased recruiting of Barton School graduates by employers [32]. The program’s success is measured by improved employment opportunities and increased employer engagement [32].

While specific placement rates for Barton School graduates are not explicitly published as a single statistic, the university reports an overall graduate employment rate of approximately 80% within six months of graduation [46]. The average salary for Barton School MBA graduates is $65,305 [46, 48]. This data point indicates the value employers place on a Barton School education and the earning potential for its graduates.  Furthermore, the school’s double AACSB accreditation, placing it in the top 1% of business schools globally, enhances its reputation among employers [52]. The Barton School’s strong industry connections, demonstrated through partnerships and recruitment events, ensure that graduates are well-prepared for successful careers in Kansas and beyond. Having examined placement rates and top employers, the following section will quantify the overall economic impact generated by Barton School alumni within the state.

## 3.4. Alumni Economic Impact

Quantifying the economic impact of Barton School of Business alumni presents a challenge due to a lack of comprehensive, statewide data specifically tracking alumni output [42]. However, available data points to significant contributions. The $500,000 investment fund created by Erin and Kyle Cummings (2009 graduates) directly supports student opportunities and future economic contributions [60a137b6, note_2d94ac6e]. Koch Industries, a major Kansas employer actively recruiting Barton School graduates, generated $133 billion in revenue in 2023 [fd8a7b9d, note_b78c0581]. The 2022 Economic Impact Study of Wichita State University and WSU Tech reported a combined $1.3 billion impact on the Kansas economy, with a multiplier effect of 2.27, meaning for every $1 million spent, an additional $1.27 million of economic activity is generated in Kansas businesses [fd8a7b9d, note_b78c0581]. While this figure encompasses the entire university, the Barton School’s role in producing a skilled workforce directly supports this economic impact. 

Alumni entrepreneurship also contributes significantly. Chris Wright (Liberty Energy), with a market capitalization of $3.33 billion and 5,500 employees, demonstrates substantial economic output [6].  Additionally, Erin Cummings, owner of YESyoga, contributes to the Kansas economy through job creation and local business revenue [3d83a57f, note_150b6c2b]. Wayne Woolsey's $10 million endowment to Wichita State University provides ongoing financial support for educational initiatives impacting the Kansas workforce [45]. Richard Dinkel, CFO of Koch Industries, and Darren Ercolani, CFO of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP, influence economic decisions within corporations generating billions in revenue [4, 43]. 

The Barton School’s emphasis on applied learning and industry connections, demonstrated through partnerships with companies like Koch Industries and Spirit AeroSystems, prepares graduates for impactful careers. These connections contribute to the $1.3 billion economic impact reported by WSU and WSU Tech [fd8a7b9d, note_b78c0581]. While a definitive quantification of Barton School alumni economic impact remains difficult, these examples demonstrate a substantial contribution to Kansas’s economic prosperity. 

Next, we will explore the Barton School’s historical development and its evolution over the last century.
