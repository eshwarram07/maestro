# Digital Surveillance in Remote Work: Power, Contracts, and Performance

# 1. Introduction

The rapid adoption of remote and hybrid work models has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of employment, bringing with it both opportunities and challenges. One significant development in this evolving environment is the proliferation of digital workplace surveillance technologies. These tools, ranging from keystroke logging and screen monitoring to sophisticated analytics and algorithmic management, allow organizations to track and analyze employee activities to an unprecedented degree. While often justified by employers as necessary for productivity, security, or compliance, the widespread implementation of such surveillance raises critical questions about its impact on the fundamental dynamics of the workplace.

This report examines the influence of digital workplace surveillance technologies on three core aspects of the employment relationship: power dynamics, psychological contracts, and employee performance. Power dynamics are inherently altered as surveillance shifts control and visibility towards the employer, potentially eroding employee autonomy and fostering resistance. The psychological contract, the unwritten set of expectations between employees and employers regarding mutual obligations and trust, is particularly vulnerable to perceived breaches stemming from intrusive or non-transparent monitoring. Furthermore, the impact on employee performance is complex, with potential benefits in accountability potentially offset by negative effects on job satisfaction, stress, creativity, and the prevalence of counterproductive behaviors.

Understanding the intricate interplay between digital surveillance and these critical organizational constructs is essential for navigating the complexities of modern work. As organizations continue to integrate technology into the fabric of daily operations, a comprehensive analysis of the consequences of surveillance is needed to inform ethical implementation, policy development, and the cultivation of healthy, productive work environments in the remote and hybrid era. This literature review aims to synthesize existing research to illuminate these impacts and highlight areas for future inquiry. The following section will delve into the literature concerning how digital surveillance reshapes power dynamics within organizations.

# 2. Literature Review

This literature review synthesizes existing academic research on the multifaceted impacts of digital workplace surveillance technologies, particularly within remote and hybrid work environments. It examines how these technologies reshape fundamental aspects of the employment relationship, beginning with an analysis of altered power dynamics and the shift in control from employees to employers. Subsequently, the review explores the influence of surveillance on the psychological contract, focusing on changes in employee expectations regarding trust, privacy, and autonomy. Finally, the section investigates the complex relationship between digital surveillance and employee performance, considering its effects on productivity, job satisfaction, and counterproductive behaviors.

## 2.1. Power Dynamics

Digital surveillance technologies fundamentally reshape power dynamics in the workplace, particularly within remote and hybrid contexts, by serving as a powerful tool for control [28][5][15][52]. This shift is characterized by the datafication and digitalization of work, making employee behavior quantifiable and visible to an unprecedented degree [28][5][15]. Advancements in information technologies allow for greater monitoring intensity than previously possible [42], extending beyond traditional performance management to encompass a wide range of employee activities, locations, and even physiological states [10][26][34]. This increased visibility and data collection capacity significantly enhances employers' "disciplining capacity" [26], enabling subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion [34]. The pervasive nature of this monitoring can lead employees to internalize control and self-discipline, akin to the panoptic effect [28][15][26].

A key implication of digital surveillance is its impact on employee autonomy. Pervasive monitoring is associated with reduced job autonomy and increased job pressures [21]. The knowledge or suspicion of being under surveillance changes employee behavior, diminishing their sense of personal autonomy and inhibiting independent thinking and creativity [48]. Algorithmic management, a form of control enabled by digital surveillance, can be perceived as demeaning and dehumanizing, further eroding self-determination, autonomy, and choice [34].

The reshaping of power dynamics by digital surveillance exhibits nuances across different work arrangements and job types, driven by the specific mechanisms of data collection and control. The shift to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, accelerated the adoption of surveillance technologies as managers sought to regain perceived control over a geographically dispersed workforce, often through electronic monitoring which acts as a job demand creating performance pressure [34][c44a3be][57]. While the spatial and temporal separation inherent in hybrid work raises questions of visibility for both managers and employees [32], digital technologies facilitate an integrated observation mode blurring the lines between online and offline activities, even extending to personal devices and off-the-clock time [34]. This integrated surveillance creates additional tensions in remote and hybrid settings by making employee behavior and presence quantifiable and visible through metrics like "little green lights" on communication platforms, fostering "productivity anxiety" [34][44].

The influence of job type on the impact of digital surveillance on power dynamics is also significant and mediated by the nature of the work and inherent autonomy. The negative implications for dignity and autonomy are particularly pronounced in precarious employment types such as gig workers, call center agents, and warehouse packers, where surveillance is often constant and abusive [34][37][46]. In these roles, algorithmic management uses automated tracking and AI for monitoring, pay rates, and discipline, creating extreme power asymmetry where workers are hyper-visible and managed by opaque algorithms [12][46]. These roles, often characterized by lower autonomy, experience more significant negative impacts [34]. Workers in clerical and skilled occupations also report higher psychosocial risks from surveillance compared to professionals and administrators [5]. This is potentially due to technology adoption leading to reduced work autonomy and increased exposure to monitoring of work speed and steps through cognitive task automation, generating higher risks for clerical roles [5]. This suggests that job roles with less inherent autonomy or those involving highly monitorable cognitive tasks may be more vulnerable to the power shifts imposed by digital surveillance [5][10]. Conversely, workers in roles like sales and services might report being better off, possibly due to technology mitigating risks like harassment [5].

In response to increased digital surveillance, employees often engage in various forms of resistance and compliance. While some level of compliance may occur, particularly implicitly due to pervasive tracking [48], resistance is a common reaction [10][18][31][42][43][54]. Resistance can manifest in overt forms like direct opposition or sabotage, or covertly through inertia, stalling, and avoidance [56]. Specific examples include evasive tactics, "foot dragging, dissimulation, false compliance, pilfering, feigned ignorance, slander, arson, sabotage" [13][34], or more digitally oriented strategies such as avoiding surveillance, piggybacking, distorting moves to subvert data collection [34], or attempting to "trick" monitoring software [52]. Awareness of constant monitoring can be counterproductive, leading to active resistance, evasion, or gaming the system [13]. Resistance is particularly strong when technology is mandated or perceived as a threat to power and control [56]. Dissatisfaction and resentment can fuel workarounds [34]. While organized resistance exists, everyday forms of resistance for immediate personal gain are also employed [27]. Stress proliferation stemming from reduced autonomy, increased pressure, and privacy violations may serve as a precursor to resistance [21].

The implementation and communication of digital surveillance technologies play a crucial role in shaping power dynamics and influencing resistance. Lack of transparency and opaque processes contribute to negative perceptions [10]. Employees are more understanding if monitoring is not considered excessive and if they are adequately informed and consulted about its nature and purpose [37][48]. Conversely, a lack of prior consultation and clear governance is a significant risk factor [48]. When employees feel they have control over the information collected and understand the reasoning for surveillance, they are more likely to trust employers and experience less stress [37]. Framing algorithmic surveillance as a tool for development, where employees have agency over the data, can mitigate negative effects and enhance trust [18]. Without transparency, particularly regarding algorithmic decision-making, trust is damaged [34]. While some research suggests potential for technology to increase employee visibility ("informatig") [15] or provide resources [8][57], the dominant narrative in the literature highlights surveillance primarily as a tool for increased employer control and potential harm to workers' rights and dignity [5][34][46][48][52]. The next section will explore the impact of these power shifts on the psychological contract between employers and employees.

## 2.2. Psychological Contracts

Digital surveillance significantly influences the psychological contract between employees and employers, which comprises the unwritten expectations and obligations perceived by both parties [3][16][23][39][c5769cec][47][49][55]. These informal agreements, built on mutual beliefs and trust, extend beyond formal employment terms and profoundly impact workplace behavior and attitudes [3][16][23][39][c5769cec][47][49][55]. The introduction and expansion of digital surveillance, particularly in remote and hybrid settings, can lead to perceived breaches of this contract, fundamentally altering employee expectations and the dynamics of the employment relationship [14][a262d883][45].

A core component of the psychological contract is trust [2][3][16][a262d883][c5769cec][45][47][55]. Digital surveillance, especially when perceived as excessive, intrusive, or lacking transparency, is a considerable threat to this trust [7][29][a262d883][45][48]. Employees who are aware of being monitored often feel mistrusted and perceived as incompetent [c5769cec][47]. This perceived lack of trust from the employer can damage the employee-employer relationship, leading to decreased job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and increased turnover intentions [2][29]. Covert monitoring is particularly detrimental to employee trust [29]. The opacity surrounding the collection, usage, storage, and management of surveillance data creates an asymmetric power balance that negatively impacts employees and reduces trust and commitment [a262d883][45].

Digital surveillance also impacts employee expectations, particularly regarding privacy, autonomy, and work-life balance. The increasing digitalization of work and the shift to remote/hybrid models have blurred the boundaries between professional and personal life [34][53]. Connected workplace surveillance, which extends data collection into personal and sensitive areas, can be perceived as disrespecting these boundaries and collecting data beyond what is necessary for performance [34]. This intrusive nature and the potential for constant tracking and algorithmic control can impede employee autonomy [51], leading to a perceived loss of dignity and contributing to a toxic work climate [55249b45][34]. Employees feel entitled to some forms of privacy, and the perceived invasion of this privacy is a common concern [29][55]. This perceived overstepping of personal boundaries and reduction in autonomy can be viewed as a breach of the psychological contract [34][a262d883][51]. The awareness of being monitored can instill fear, particularly the fear of job loss or that non-work-related activities, even during breaks, could be viewed negatively, further impacting expectations about fair evaluation and autonomy [35].

Specific types of digital surveillance technologies uniquely influence these expectations and perceptions. Keystroke logging and screen monitoring, for instance, directly impact expectations of privacy and autonomy over one's digital workspace by creating a sense of constant observation and control over minute actions [14][29][55]. Video monitoring in remote or hybrid settings extends surveillance into the employee's personal environment, uniquely challenging privacy expectations by bringing the workplace gaze into private spaces and further blurring work-life boundaries [34][53]. Location tracking, particularly when it extends beyond work hours or necessary tasks, can be perceived as a significant intrusion into private life, breaching expectations related to work-life balance and personal freedom by monitoring movement outside of work duties [34][35]. Algorithmic management, which uses data from various surveillance methods to automate decisions, can uniquely affect perceived fairness and trust, as employees may not understand the complex logic behind automated decisions regarding their performance or future [34]. This opaque, machine-driven decision-making process can lead to feelings of dehumanization and a lack of control over one's career path, fundamentally altering the perceived obligations of the employer to provide fair, understandable, and human-centric evaluation and management [55249b45][34].

A perceived psychological contract breach, whether related to trust, privacy, or autonomy, can lead to significant negative attitudinal and behavioral outcomes [2][33][41]. These include feelings of violation, injustice, or betrayal [3][16][24][a262d883][45][55], decreased job satisfaction and commitment [2][14][41], negative emotional responses [3][16][55], and reduced performance and productivity [2][a262d883][41][c5769cec][47]. Employees may experience increased stress and anxiety due to the feeling of being continuously monitored [14][15][25][29][a262d883][48], which can be exacerbated by unclear reasons for punishment based on monitored behavior [15]. This can lead to a decreased sense of control over their economic and social stability [2].

Transparency and clear communication are crucial for mitigating the negative impacts of digital surveillance on psychological contracts [7][14][29][a262d883][45][48][55]. Employees are more receptive to monitoring if they are informed about the practices beforehand, understand the reasons and benefits, and perceive the process as fair [a262d883][45][48][55]. Allowing employees to view their productivity data and turn off monitoring during permitted breaks are suggested strategies for building trust and perceived control [29]. Conversely, a lack of transparency, particularly regarding algorithmic decision-making, damages trust [34].

The digitalization of work is also leading to a transformation of psychological contracts, expanding from traditional dyadic relationships to include multiple parties [17][30]. The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote and hybrid work have further influenced employee expectations, particularly regarding work flexibility and autonomy [3][16]. While some argue that monitoring enables flexible and remote work by allowing for "light-touch" management [29], the widespread implementation of surveillance technologies has underscored the negative implications of perceived control and mistrust in these settings [20]. Establishing clear psychological contracts can help delineate boundaries related to remote work and personal life, such as disconnection times [40].

Overall, digital surveillance, while potentially offering benefits like enabling flexible work, poses significant risks to the psychological contract by eroding trust [7][14][29][a262d883][45][48], infringing upon perceived privacy [14][29][a262d883][c5769cec][47][51][55], and reducing employee autonomy [34][48][51]. These perceived breaches can lead to negative employee attitudes and behaviors, impacting the overall health of the employment relationship. The next section will examine the influence of digital workplace surveillance on employee performance.

## 2.3. Employee Performance

Digital workplace surveillance technologies have a complex and often contradictory relationship with employee performance metrics, encompassing outcomes such as productivity, job satisfaction, and counterproductive work behaviors. While employers often implement surveillance with the goal of enhancing performance, compliance, and security [50], the actual impact is multifaceted and depends heavily on the type of surveillance, its implementation, and employee perceptions [10].

Research on the direct impact of electronic performance monitoring (EPM) and digital surveillance on productivity yields mixed results. Some academic studies suggest a potential positive impact, particularly for simple and repetitive tasks, possibly due to social facilitation effects [22]. Proponents argue that knowing they are observed can motivate employees through objective measurement and the potential for rewards, which can help employees understand performance expectations [6][319cd0c5][11]. However, a systematic academic literature review found mixed evidence, preventing a definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of digital surveillance for improving performance across various contexts [6][319cd0c5].

Conversely, a significant body of academic literature highlights the potential negative consequences of digital surveillance on employee performance and related factors [10][14][34][ac5ea482][50]. Excessive or poorly implemented surveillance can lead to decreased job satisfaction [4][10][14][22][36][ac5ea482][50][fe0ecbf0], reduced organizational commitment [10][14][22][50][fe0ecbf0], and increased stress and burnout [10][14][22][34][aa9df693][44][50][ee033ab6]. These negative psycho-social outcomes can indirectly impact performance [10]. Close performance monitoring, particularly when used for punishment, is continuous, unpredictable, or assessed at a group level, is negatively associated with job attitudes [50]. Similarly, algorithmic decision-making based on surveillance data, especially when opaque, can negatively impact job satisfaction and well-being [34]. Qualitative studies suggest that electronic monitoring has adverse effects on employee attitude, job commitment, satisfaction, morale, and behavior, with negative impacts often surpassing expected benefits [ac5ea482].

Digital surveillance is frequently linked to an increase in counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs) [1][10][22][7b0007a5][34][aaa65ca0][38][50]. This may be more pronounced with poor implementation or in roles requiring high autonomy [50]. CWBs can include intentional loafing, avoidance behaviors, or evasive tactics aimed at counteracting perceived loss of freedom or circumventing excessive oversight [34][50][19]. Cyberslacking, a form of CWB involving nonwork IT use, is negatively associated with electronic monitoring when perceived as an inhibitor [b8fd564e]. However, knowing one is constantly monitored can lead to active resistance, evasion, or tricking the system [34]. Unaddressed ethical concerns and a damaged employee-employer relationship can lead to negative attitudes and CWBs [14][aaa65ca0].

Beyond direct productivity measures, digital surveillance can erode intrinsic motivation, especially when linked to contingent rewards/punishments or limiting employee choice [50]. It can hinder the fulfillment of basic psychological needs (competence, relatedness, autonomy), thereby reducing intrinsic motivation [50]. Surveillance is also associated with decreased problem-solving performance and lower individual creativity [50]. In teams, it may reduce psychological safety, inhibiting the translation of intrinsic motivation into creativity [50]. The pressure to constantly appear "onstage" due to increased managerial control can lead to "surface acting," negatively impacting well-being and satisfaction due to a lack of authenticity [50]. Techno-stress, particularly techno-invasion, is a significant predictor of workplace stressors and burnout [50]. Excessive digital workplace demands, including "timer type aspects" of surveillance, can impair physical and mental health [aa9df693][44]. Productivity anxiety, the fear of not being seen as productive digitally, may foster hyperconnectivity and overwork, influencing behavior and performance [aa9df693]. Techno-overwhelm from excessive messages and applications leads to fatigue and depletion, hindering effective performance [aa9df693].

The impact of digital surveillance on employee performance is not uniform and is significantly moderated by various factors, including individual psychological factors (reactance, self-efficacy, ethical orientation, goal orientation) [50], the design and application of monitoring technologies, and surrounding managerial practices [10]. Crucially, perceptions of fairness and transparency play a key moderating role [36]. If employees perceive surveillance as fair and transparent, negative effects on performance and job satisfaction may be mitigated [9]. Unclear purpose or "function creep" in monitoring reduces perceptions of fairness and justice, negatively impacting satisfaction, trust, commitment, creativity, and autonomy [10]. Lack of transparency reduces task satisfaction, justice perceptions, trust, and performance [10]. Conversely, transparent and fair policies are needed to build trust [36]. Development-focused performance monitoring may have beneficial impacts on job satisfaction and be more readily accepted [50]. Shifting towards employee self-monitoring or self-tracking, where employees own the data for personal development, may harness intrinsic motivation and mitigate some negative effects [50]. Earned acceptance through communication and trust is crucial for balancing monitoring uses with employee resistance [50].

Given the inconsistent academic evidence on digital surveillance's effectiveness for improving performance [6][319cd0c5], alternative approaches, such as creating psychologically safe workplaces that foster internal motivation, might be more effective [6][319cd0c5]. While monitoring might reduce non-work activities and flag security issues, it can also lead to anxiety, stifled creativity, psychological discomfort, and inhibit risk-taking [6][319cd0c5]. These factors can contribute to dissatisfaction and increased turnover, creating inefficiencies [319cd0c5]. Academic studies indicate that companies with minimal surveillance and high trust may outperform peers with higher ROI, suggesting trust enhances retention and financial returns [11]. Organizations employing less invasive monitoring tools experienced lower attrition rates [11]. Mindful surveillance practices using real-time analytics and feedback may help identify signs of burnout [11].

The long-term effects of sustained digital workplace surveillance on employee performance and career progression are less explored but are critical. Pervasive surveillance can negatively impact company culture and retention rates [11], potentially leading to increased turnover [4][11]. Highly monitored employees are less likely to be engaged [11]. Increased monitoring can exacerbate anxiety and burnout, particularly in remote settings [ee033ab6]. While surveillance can enhance accountability and workforce optimization [11], balancing accountability and autonomy is crucial, as autonomy positively impacts productivity [11].

In conclusion, the literature presents a nuanced picture of the relationship between digital workplace surveillance and employee performance. While potential benefits related to productivity and accountability are sometimes reported, particularly with objective measurement and clear feedback, the risks of negative impacts on job satisfaction, stress, motivation, creativity, and the increase in counterproductive work behaviors are substantial and widely documented. The effectiveness and impact of surveillance are heavily mediated by factors such as transparency, perceived fairness, and the degree to which it erodes employee autonomy and trust. The following discussion section will synthesize these findings within the broader context of power dynamics and psychological contracts.

# 3. Discussion

The literature review has illuminated the profound and complex ways in which digital workplace surveillance technologies are reshaping the employment landscape in remote and hybrid settings. A critical analysis of the findings reveals significant implications for power dynamics, psychological contracts, and employee performance, while also highlighting ethical concerns and gaps in current understanding.

The review demonstrates that digital surveillance acts as a potent instrument for shifting power towards employers, enabling unprecedented levels of control and datafication of work [28][5][15]. This enhanced monitoring capacity, extending beyond traditional performance metrics, allows for subtle forms of influence and discipline [26][34]. A key consequence is the erosion of employee autonomy, particularly in precarious roles and those requiring less cognitive complexity [5][21][34]. The pervasive nature of monitoring can lead employees to internalize control, mirroring the panoptic effect [28][15][26]. However, this increased control often triggers resistance, ranging from overt opposition to covert evasion tactics [10][18][31][42][43][54]. The level of transparency and employee consultation regarding surveillance implementation significantly influences these power dynamics and the likelihood of resistance [37][48]. While some argue for surveillance's potential to increase employee visibility or provide resources [8][15][57], the dominant finding underscores its role in augmenting employer control, potentially infringing upon workers' rights and dignity [5][34][46][48][52].

The impact on the psychological contract is equally significant. Digital surveillance, particularly when perceived as excessive or non-transparent, fundamentally challenges the unwritten expectations of trust, privacy, and autonomy that underpin the employee-employer relationship [7][29][a262d883][45][48]. Employees often feel mistrusted and undervalued when subjected to pervasive monitoring [c5769cec][47], leading to decreased job satisfaction and increased turnover intentions [2][29]. The blurring of work-life boundaries in remote/hybrid settings exacerbates concerns about privacy invasion through intrusive monitoring techniques [34][53]. Perceived breaches of the psychological contract, whether related to trust, privacy, or autonomy, result in negative outcomes such as emotional distress, reduced commitment, and diminished performance [2][33][41]. Transparency and fairness in surveillance practices are crucial for mitigating these negative effects and preserving trust [7][14][29][a262d883][45][48][55]. The digitalization of work is also evolving the psychological contract itself, extending it beyond the traditional dyadic relationship [17][30].

Regarding employee performance, the literature presents a complex and sometimes contradictory picture. While some studies and organizational reports suggest potential productivity increases, particularly for routine tasks or when data is used for optimization [6][11][22], a substantial body of evidence points to detrimental effects. Excessive or poorly implemented surveillance is linked to decreased job satisfaction, increased stress, burnout, and reduced organizational commitment [4][10][14][22][36][ac5ea482][50][fe0ecbf0]. These negative psycho-social outcomes can indirectly impair performance [10]. Furthermore, digital surveillance is frequently associated with an increase in counterproductive work behaviors, as employees seek to resist or circumvent perceived overreach [1][10][22][7b0007a5][34][aaa65ca0][38][50]. Surveillance can also erode intrinsic motivation, hinder creativity and problem-solving, and contribute to techno-stress and burnout [aa9df693][44][50]. The impact is heavily moderated by factors such as perceived fairness, transparency, and respect for autonomy [9][36]. Development-focused or self-monitoring approaches may offer more positive outcomes [50]. The inconsistent evidence suggests that fostering a psychologically safe workplace built on trust may be more effective for long-term performance and retention than relying solely on surveillance [6][319cd0c5][11].

Synthesizing these findings, it becomes clear that the impacts on power dynamics, psychological contracts, and employee performance are deeply interconnected and mutually reinforcing in the context of digital surveillance. The shift in power towards the employer, driven by enhanced monitoring capabilities and the erosion of employee autonomy, directly influences the psychological contract. When employees perceive a loss of control and feel mistrusted due to pervasive surveillance, this constitutes a breach of the psychological contract, particularly concerning expectations of privacy and autonomy [a262d883][45][51]. This breach, in turn, has significant consequences for employee performance. Feeling undervalued, stressed, and lacking control due to surveillance can lead to decreased job satisfaction, reduced commitment, and ultimately, diminished productivity and increased counterproductive work behaviors [2][a262d883][41][c5769cec][47]. The resistance observed in response to increased surveillance [10][18][31][42][43][54] can be interpreted as a behavioral manifestation of both the altered power dynamic and the perceived psychological contract breach. Employees actively seeking to evade or "trick" monitoring systems [52] are simultaneously resisting employer control and attempting to reclaim a sense of autonomy and privacy that they feel has been unfairly taken. Thus, the power imbalance created by surveillance negatively impacts the psychological contract, leading to adverse behavioral and attitudinal outcomes that ultimately affect performance. Conversely, when surveillance is implemented with transparency and perceived fairness, respecting employee privacy and autonomy, the negative impacts on the psychological contract and performance are mitigated [9][36]. This suggests that the ethical implementation of surveillance, which considers its impact on both power dynamics and the psychological contract, is crucial for fostering positive performance outcomes.

The findings collectively underscore significant ethical considerations. The potential for digital surveillance to facilitate discrimination, exacerbate inequalities (particularly for precarious workers), and cause psychological harm necessitates careful consideration of its implementation [34][37][46]. The lack of transparency around algorithmic decision-making and data usage raises concerns about fairness and accountability [34][a262d883][45]. Ethical frameworks and clear regulations are needed to govern the collection, use, and storage of employee data, ensuring respect for privacy and dignity [34][46][48][52].

Despite the insights gained, several gaps remain in the current literature. There is a need for more quantitative research directly linking specific types of digital surveillance technologies to objective performance metrics across diverse job roles and industries. The moderating effects of organizational culture, leadership styles, and the specific design and configuration of remote/hybrid work arrangements on the impact of surveillance require further exploration. Long-term studies are needed to understand the sustained effects of pervasive digital surveillance on employee well-being, career progression, and organizational culture. Research differentiating the impacts of surveillance based on the nature of work (e.g., knowledge work vs. routine tasks) and the autonomy inherent in different roles would provide valuable nuance. Furthermore, exploring the potential for technology to empower employees or facilitate self-management, rather than solely focusing on control, represents a critical avenue for future inquiry.

In conclusion, digital workplace surveillance technologies represent a powerful force reshaping the dynamics of work. While proponents highlight potential benefits related to productivity and accountability, the evidence strongly suggests significant risks to power balance, psychological contracts, and employee well-being and performance. Addressing the ethical implications, prioritizing transparency and fairness, and fostering trust are paramount for navigating this complex landscape responsibly. Future research should aim to fill existing knowledge gaps, providing a more comprehensive understanding of these technologies' multifaceted impacts and informing the development of ethical and effective workplace practices in the digital age. The final section will provide a summary of the key findings and concluding remarks.

# 4. Conclusion

This literature review has explored the multifaceted impacts of digital workplace surveillance technologies on power dynamics, psychological contracts, and employee performance, particularly within the evolving landscape of remote and hybrid work. The analysis reveals that these technologies fundamentally alter the balance of power, shifting control towards employers through enhanced data collection and monitoring capabilities. This increased surveillance capacity, while sometimes framed as a tool for efficiency or security, frequently erodes employee autonomy and fosters a climate of distrust, leading to resistance and counterproductive behaviors.

The review also highlights the significant strain digital surveillance places on the psychological contract between employees and employers. Perceptions of excessive monitoring, lack of transparency, and intrusion into personal space are frequently interpreted as breaches of trust and privacy expectations. These perceived violations can result in negative emotional responses, decreased job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and a reduced sense of fairness and control over one's work life.

Furthermore, the literature presents a complex picture regarding the impact of digital surveillance on employee performance. While some evidence suggests potential productivity gains in certain contexts, particularly for routine tasks, a substantial body of research points to detrimental effects. Negative consequences include increased stress and burnout, diminished intrinsic motivation and creativity, and a rise in counterproductive work behaviors. The effectiveness of surveillance as a performance management tool appears heavily contingent on its implementation, with transparency, perceived fairness, and respect for employee autonomy serving as critical moderating factors.

In conclusion, understanding the intricate interplay between digital workplace surveillance, power dynamics, psychological contracts, and employee performance is crucial for navigating the complexities of modern work environments. The findings underscore the importance of ethical considerations, transparency, and a focus on building trust rather than relying solely on control mechanisms. Ongoing research is essential to further explore the long-term effects of these technologies, differentiate impacts across various job types and work arrangements, and develop best practices for implementing surveillance in a manner that respects employee rights and fosters a healthy and productive work environment.
